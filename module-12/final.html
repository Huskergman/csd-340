                        One of my favorite pass times and hobbies currently is playing video games with my friends and family. Some of my favorite games that I like to play are Escape from Tarkov, Apex Legends, Call of Duty, and Minecraft. Gaming is a harmless pass time that I seem to find joy in and it can be as cheap or expensive as you would like to go. Once you get past the initial startup cost you and the games you want you are able to have hours of entertainment in the comfort of your own home.

                       My second hobby is working on my vehicles. I currently own a 2015 Scion FR-R and a 1993 Nissan 240SX. My favorite era of cars in early 90s Japanese sports cars and that is why I have the vehicles that I own now. Japanese sports cars have always attracted my attention and is the big reason as to why I love working on them so much. This is a fun, but expensive hobby so I don't get to work on this hobby as much as I would like to but eye enjoy it when I have the time and money to.

                        Lastly, when I am not gaming or working on my cars I love spending time with my family. Spending time with my family is one of my favorite past times. I enjoy sitting down and watching a movie or our favorite tv series at the time. My family and I also love going out to eat with our favorite restaurant being HuHot.

                        I have been in the military now for almost 6 years. I enlisted in January of 2017 and I have enjoyed it ever since. My career field that I went into was Cybersecurity and it has definitely paid off with my full time career. I have been deployed a handful of times my most recent deployments were to Afghanistan and Guam. Both were fun deployments, however, I enjoyed the beaches of Guam a lot more than the desert of Kandahar.

                        Currently, I work from home remotely as a Compliance Engineer and I would not have gotten this far in my career if it weren't for my military experience. The training and experience that I have obtained has allowed me to sling shot my career to where I am competing with candidates that are twice my age. My previous jobs before my current position were a Sr. Cybersecurity Specialist, a Cybersecurity Engineer, and a Cybersecurity Specialist. I would not trade it for anything and I am very thankful to be where I am at today and plan to continue to progress further with my career.

                        For schooling I have recently started back up in pursuit of obtaining my bachelors degree in software development. I already obtained my associates degree in applied science for general education. It was something simple that I could obtain quickly to start the accelerated program that Bellevue University offers. Other than that I have attended several schools for the military pertaining to Cybersecurity and other IT related classes and I even obtained my Security Plus certification from CompTIA. I am still currently undecided as to whether or not I want to continue with my education after obtaining my degree, but it is not entirely out of the question.
